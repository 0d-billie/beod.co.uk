Hi! I'm Eibhlín; a musician, creative writer, linguistics fan, bad minimalist, and blåhaj friend from Leeds (rule of three be damned). This website is the central hub of my online activity, where you can find a blog and links to my other projects.

I have had a blog on and off over the years, all of which are now consigned to the great Internet archive, and never to be seen on the surface of the web again. This is a fresh start, as it were. I make no promises of regular posting or of coherency, and all the usual discaimers about lack of warranty apply ;)
