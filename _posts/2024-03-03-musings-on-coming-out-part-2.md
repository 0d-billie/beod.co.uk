excerpt: "Part the Second: Coming out to my partner"
---

In Part One I talked inarticulately about the intronautic journey I undertook to come to the conclusion that I am in fact, transgender. This time around I want to talk about coming out to my (then) partner. I am now no longer in a relationship with that person, and so to preserve their anonymity I'll just be referring to them by their initial, C.

## Don't make a dick joke
If I have one piece of advice for anyone whose partner comes out as a trans woman, it would be that at all costs, do no let your first response be a joke (however humorous or lighthearted) about mourning the loss of your partner's penis. It took me weeks to work up the courage to talk to C about that remark, ad while they confirmed that it was indeed just a joke, it caused me a lot of consternation while I grappled with it. It felt like the person I was completely in love with, with whom I had just entrusted a secret that I hadn't ever dared even say to myself, was giving me an ultimatum.

With that aside, C was a wonderful person to have around me while I first started to explore my gender more openly. There were of course some initial teething problems. The rapidity with which I wanted to start trying new things was a bit much for C. I was extremely excited to get to trying new things like pronouns and names and clothes, and I think it frightened them how quickly I seemed to be changing. We spent a lot of time together talking about transition and what it meant for me and for us as a couple, but disagreements were rare. If anything, C seemed just as enthusiastic as I was to explore this "new" side of me. They were doing a lot of their own reading and learning, and suggesting resources for me to read or watch, outfits or hairstyles I might want to try. Almost immediately I realised how much of a burden the prospect of rejection had been. To have it lifted and be wholly accepted by my partner was nothing short of miraculous. It's entirely possible that had C not been a passionate co-conspirator that I might have taken myself right back into the closet.

## What's in a name?
Ahh, names. Look on any transgender forum and you'll see countless threads talking about what names to choose. It's such well-trodden ground that naming clich√©s have now developed among the trans community. My birth name was William, but for as long as I can possibly remember I had only ever gone by Bill. I felt a strong sense of ownership over the nickname, and the full form felt alien to me, long before I came out as trans. Heck, one of my favourite Doctor Who companions was a Bill! But it never felt quite like I belonged to it. I longed for something different, more feminine.

A major factor in choosing a name was that I wasn't ready to come out to the world just yet. I was only just ready to engage with this for myself, let alone the world at large. What if I was wrong? What if I weren't trans at all and I had to un-come out to everyone? The prospect was mortifying (more on that later), and not one I felt equipped to deal with back then. So, as with my ideas about adjusting stage outfits to be more feminine, I opted for the route of plausible deniability, and asked C to start calling me Billie. It was reasonable enough for my partner to have a slightly different name for me that they could say in front of others. And to the best of my knowledge, it went unchallenged.

And oh, what a difference it made. My fellow trans folks will be familiar with the concept of gender euphoria. And that extra syllable, those two little letters were enough to set me aglow with it for days. Almost three years and one heartbreak later, two memories still fill me with happy feelings. The first was the first time that C called to me from downstairs. I can still hear perfectly how their voice sang out the two syllables, the rhythm with which they spoke them, the exact pitch and duration of the utterance. And the second was a moment when, out of the blue, C sent me a flurry of texts, but the first one (and the only notification that showed up) was just the two words "**OMG, BILLIE!**"

Both memories send shivers of delight through me. On both of those occasions and on many afterwards, I felt a strong sense of belonging to my name which I hadn't ever experienced before. It was (and is) a wonderful feeling.


## Longer term fallout
As the weeks and months went by and I grew into my role of gendernaut, C began to have some of their own complex feelings about their own gender.
