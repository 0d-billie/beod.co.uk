excerpt: "Part the Second: Coming out to my partner"
---

In Part One I talked inarticulately about the process of coming to terms with the fact that I'm transgender, and the intronautic journey I undertook to come to that conclusion. This time around I want to talk about coming out to my (then) partner. I am now no longer with that person, and so to preserve their anonymity I'll be using their initials: CJ.

## Immediate aftermath
- Early explorations
  - Doing nails, hair, new clothes
  - Trying a different name
    - "OMG BILLIE"
- Penis jokes
-


## Longer term fallout
- Charlie thinking about gender
  - Transitioning simultaneously
- Changing names
  - Telling families
- Sex 

## A breakup, a reconciliation, and another breakup
- Straining the relationship
  - Pressures we put on ourselves and each other
  - Switching from a cis-het relationship to a queer one
- Breakup after living together
  - Reconcile after a couple of months
  - Together but on borrowed time
- Breaking up for various reasons
