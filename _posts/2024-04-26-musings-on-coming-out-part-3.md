excerpt: "Part the Third: Coming out to my family"
---

Why haven't I mentioned coming out to my friends?
1. My friends are like my family in many respects
2. Coming out to them all was such a non-event as to make it uninteresting to write about
3. Kester's wedding

A lot of time passed before I felt ready to come out to my family. I have always felt the need to display certainty and assuredness. Demonstrate authority, and commitment to what I say and do. I dreaded having to un-come out, and so I waited for a very long time before I managed to do it, with many false starts.

The word woman was not one I was yet comfortable with. It would take me a long time to think anything other than "girl," much less _say_ it.
