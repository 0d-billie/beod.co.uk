In my mid twenties, while I was seeking a solution to the depression and sense of being lost that had been my constant companion for years, and in tandem with weekly therapy and daily antidepressants, I read as many self-help books as I could lay my hands on. Some were more useful than others, and some have turned out to be more controversial than I would have expected. But none was entirely useless.


# 1. It Takes a Village
You have to raise yourself, but you can't raise a child alone, so why raise yourself alone? Find, build, and maintain a support network

# 3. Hate is Worthless, Forgiveness is Everything
No longer Catholic, still believe in the power of forgiveness

# 5. Science Makes Life Possible, Art Makes Life Bearable


# 6. The Author is Dead, Long Live the Reader
Death of the author

# 8. 5 Minutes, 27 Years
Find meaningful markers of time; use them liberally
Saturn Return
Five minutes to make a positive change to your environs
Eight days to make a decision

# 9. Themes Over Goals

# 10. Tweenage Dreams
Hobbits come of age at 33

# 11. Choose Your Words With Care
What you mean and what people think you mean can be two different things

# 12. Scaffolds and Frameworks are Meant to Save Time
Put routines, systems, frameworks, whatever in place
But don't spend any more time than is necessary working on them

# 13. Maintain Awe and Wonder


# 14. Define Your Path, Walk it Relentlessly, Meander at Will
Spend time to really think about your goals, your objectives, and your dreams
List them, tag them, categorise them, sort them
Define the most important theme/tag/category
Define the second most important theme/tag/category
Define the third most important theme/tag/category
Write these down somewhere you can see them
Work towards them for a year
Revisit them
Repeat

For me:
Legacy <- Health <- Support

# 15. Don't Undervalue a Portfolio Lifestyle

When a child discovers that their parents make mistakes they become and adolescent
When an adolescent forgives their parents for those mistakes, they become an adult
When an adult forgives themselves their own mistakes, they become wise

# 26. Say yes to everything and always take the stairs
(Gratefully added by mum)
