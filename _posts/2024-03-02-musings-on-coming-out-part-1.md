[One year ago today](https://www.instagram.com/p/CpSOTeAs0Oh/) I finally "finished" coming out (inasmuch as I had nobody else in my life left to tell). 366 days later, I wanted to document some of my thoughts and feelings from the experience, how it went, what I might do differently had I the chance to do it again, and  

FINISH THE ABOVE PARAGRAPH!

## Setting the scene

The most important part of any coming out story is the moment you allow yourself to say the words to yourself and mean it. Many queer people struggle with even this initial first step due to internalised trans and/or homophobia, and years-to-decades of repression. For my part, I had been uncomfortable with my assigned gender and body since I had been a teenager, and struggled to relate to many of my contemporaries at school from an even younger age. The earliest memory I have of being told to not behave like such a girl was at school, aged 5. 

I had had many aborted attempts at exploring my gender expression over the years. I would try out feminine clothing, hair, and makeup until it all became too much for me and I would purge  all of the accumulated paraphernaila as I put that part of my brain back in a locked box, seemingly dealt with and silenced. Probably 90-95% of this exploration was a solo endeavour, and the few times I did engage with my identity with another person (romantic partners on all occasions), it was quickly shut down either by me or by the other. I was petrified of the word "transgender" and thought of myself as a cross-dresser, or perhaps someone with a very particular kink. Given the consistent solitude of my voyages of self-discovery, there was a large sexual dimension to the process. It wasn't until later that I would learn that this is a [very](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en/am-i-trans#consider-that-it-s-rarely-just-a-fetish) common experience amongst trans people.
