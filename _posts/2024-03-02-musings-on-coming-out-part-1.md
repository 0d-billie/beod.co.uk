excerpt: "Part the First: Coming out to myself"

[One year ago today](https://www.instagram.com/p/CpSOTeAs0Oh/) I finally "finished" coming out (inasmuch as I had nobody else in my life left to tell). 366 days later, I wanted to document some of my thoughts and feelings from the experience, how it went, what I might do differently had I the chance to do it again, and just leave a record of my experience.

## Setting the scene
The most important part of any coming out story is the moment you allow yourself to say the words to yourself and mean it. Many queer people struggle with even this initial first step due to internalised trans and/or homophobia, and years-to-decades of repression. For my part, I had been uncomfortable with my assigned gender and body since I had been a teenager, and struggled to relate to many of my contemporaries at school from an even younger age. The earliest memory I have of being told to not behave like such a girl was at school, aged 5. I had burst into tears in response to a sort of charades-esque game in which someone had to pretend to stop being my friend. Later that day at break I was teased mercilessly for this lapse in masculinity.

When I was young and still sharing a bedroom with my younger sister she had a book called [The Toilet of Doom](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Toilet-Doom-Jiggy-McCue-Story/dp/1841217522) in which the male protagonist swaps bodies with one of his best friends, who just happens to be a girl. All sorts of hilarity and hijinks ensue, and ultimately they get swapped back. I read and reread this book, fascinated by the segment during which Jiggy has Angie's body, and was always disappointed when the story remained the same and they were able to switch back. I don't remember thinking anything specific of that at the time, and I guess I just associated it with the usual sense of loss one feels when finishing a beloved story. If I had an earlier exposure to the concept of genderbending fiction, I do not remember it.

I have had many aborted attempts at exploring my gender expression over the years. I would try out feminine clothing, hair, and makeup until it all became too much for me and I would purge  all of the accumulated paraphernaila as I put that part of my brain back in a locked box, seemingly dealt with and silenced. Probably 90-95% of this exploration was a solo endeavour, and the few times I did engage with my identity with another person (romantic partners on all occasions), it was quickly shut down either by me or by the other. I was petrified of the word "transgender" and thought of myself as a cross-dresser, or perhaps someone with a very particular kink. Given the consistent solitude of my voyages of self-discovery, there was a large sexual dimension to the process. It wasn't until later that I would learn that this is a [very](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en/am-i-trans#consider-that-it-s-rarely-just-a-fetish) [common](https://medium.com/@kemenatan/its-just-a-fetish-right-91cb0a4e261) [experience](https://stainedglasswoman.substack.com/p/beneath-the-surface) amongst trans people.

## A button on a desert island
In the trans community, eggs (the affectionate term given to trans people who have yet to "hatch") are constantly seeking out resources to try and understand the complicated feelings they are experiencing. There are a wealth of communities on the Internet dedicated to helping burgeoning trans people identify what they're feeling and answer the question "could I be transgender?" I found many such communities and threw myself into them with abandon, desperate for understanding. I understand _now_ that I was in fact looking for permission to transition. For someone to tell me that I was allowed to do this. And maybe to say it would all work out in the end.

One of the simplest tools in the arsenal of the egg trying to work out if they want to hatch is [The Button Test](https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/the-button-test-how-a-button-press). Not a psychological or diagnostic tool, but a thought experiment designed to prompt the taker into thinking properly about what their assigned gender means to them, and how they would feel about changing it. It boils down to a set of questions, loosely as follows (paraphrased from Erin's article linked above, seriously go read that):

1. You are given a button to press. If you press it, you will become physically female. All of your family and friends will have always remembered you this way and you will have no social impacts to your life for making this decision. Once you press the button, it will disappear forever. Do you press the button?
2. Another button appears. Instead of changing your physical form, this one would alter your mind so that you no longer wish to be female. You will forget about the button and it will disappear forever. Do you press the button?
3. You are stranded on a desert island which has everything you need on it to live in relative comfort. Several suitcases wash ashore with all kinds of different clothes, makeup, etc. How do you present yourself knowing nobody will ever be around to see you ever again?
4. A lifetime supply of hormones washes on shore with full instructions on how to safely use them. Do you take the hormones?
5. Suppose I told you this test was perfect, and it said that you are 100% transgender. How would that make you feel?
6. What if I told you the test said you are NOT transgender, how would _that_ make you feel?
