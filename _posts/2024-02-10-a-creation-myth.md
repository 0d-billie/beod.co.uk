It is not remembered how the Nothing came to be. Some among the wise believe that a devastating war between forgotten worlds destroyed the filaments of existence. And in the aftermath of this war the very Breath which holds all life together was scattered across the infinite reaches of time and space, spread so thinly that it became as nothing. Yet others believe that there was nothing Before, and that forces beyond any reckoning or imagining slowly Breathed life into the vast emptiness.

What is remembered is that there was simply Nothing, for uncountable aeons. Not sky or sea, not day or night, not hot or cold. The Breath of all life and creation seemed all but snuffed out. And yet, after an age of ages the smallest wisps of Breath coalesced together into the form of a tiny spider. And in the void between worlds, that spider did as all spiders do and spun her webs. 

As she spun away in the depths of time, more wisps of Breath grew together and formed flies and moths and all manner of minute insects. The spider ensnared her prey in the vast web, and grew large on their meat. And as she grew, so too did her webs grow to span further and deeper into the Nothing, and so doing the ravenous spider captured more prey than even she could eat. These excess she encased in silk, and lay them strewn across the infinite reaches of her web where, in time, they became the first stars in the sky.

For years and years beyond any numbering she spun and ate and ensnared and stored her prey in shining globes of silk. Her body grew enormous to match the great enormity of her web. It is said that for even she to travel from one end of her domain to the other would take more years than there are drops of water in all of the world's lakes, rivers, and seas. And amidst the multitude of stars, the gift of creation was bestowed unto the spider, and she laid a clutch of five eggs. And so she became the First Mother.

When the First Mother's brood hatched, she named them in accordance with their temperament and aspect. The first of her children was Fire, named for her short temper and her subtle sharpness. The second she named Air, for she shared her sister's subtlety but was softer and was possessed of a simple grace. The third child was called Water, and she was like her second sister in grace but had about her a depth and solidity that her first siblings could not hope to match. The First Mother named the fourth child Earth, for she was sturdy and still, and was in all ways her first sister's opposite. The fifth child was mean and twisted, for the birth from her egg had been cruelly difficult, and so she was given her name: Chaos.

The sisters were united in the awe of their mother's creation from the very first, and marvelled at the beauty of the stars strewn among the infinite reaches of the web that was their home.  They dared not consume even a single morsel of that food which the First Mother had stored, for they feared it would rouse her anger, and would mar the majesty of her infinite web.

Hunger was the constant companion of the First Children in those early days after their birth, for the ready supply of prey that was the provision of the Breath grew short. Together, while their Mother grew weak and incapable of feeding herself, the five Sisters roamed in search of food, but found none. As hunger gnawed at their spirits, the five sisters grew impatient and ill-tempered with each other and discord grew between them. Alone among the five did Chaos thrive in this environment, for her existence had always been one of strife and torment, and ever she has known how to turn such things to her advantage.

Eventually they returned to the First Mother with their stomachs empty and their hearts weighed down by enmity. But fate struck another blow to the Sisters, for they found that their mother, ancient beyond any reckoning, lay dead in her web, starved of food. Desperation mingled with the grief of the Sisters, for they knew that they must eat her flesh to survive. It was Chaos who suggested that they should each attempt to preserve a part of their mother, so that they might remember her always.  

Earth severed and preserved the Mother's head, and set it hanging in the void from a single line of silk. Guided by Earth's firm working, the flesh dried and withered, and she shaped it ever rounder and more perfect, until at last it took on the shape of the world. It is said that if one were to dig down into the centre of the world that a great brain would be within.

Fire took from the First Mother's head each of her eight eyes. One of these, she set ablaze, so hot and sharp was her grief. The fiery orb burned too hot for any of the sisters to bare, and Fire cast it out into the void on a line of silk from the Mother's head. The remaining eyes, Fire also sent spinning around the world at different distances, so that the Mother might still admire her creation from many vantages. Thus, the sun, the four moons, and the two wandering planets in the night sky were sent orbiting the world. Even in death the First Mother watches the world from near and far, marvelling at all creation.

Water took from the First Mother her remaining silk, and cast it flowing ceaselessly around the surface of the Mother's head, where it filled the empty sockets of her eyes and overflowed. So the seas and oceans were spilled, and the rivers of the world set running. It is said that those who look long enough into the water will see a glimpse of the great web of creation beyond our sky.

Air took the hair from the Mother's back much of it whitened with age, and blew the strands all over the newly formed world, where they clumped and collected, and began to form the first clouds. Air's breath whipped up the surface of the waters, and with that the clouds came to cling on to some of Water's own gift However out of respect for her sister, Air forced her creation to return the water to the surface below from time to time, and so created the rain.

Looking upon what they had done, the first four Sisters were overcome at the sight of the world they had created from the First Mother's remains. And though they felt great joy at the beauty of the tribute they wept also. When they finally turned to quench their perishing hunger, Chaos again stopped them that she might give her own gift..

Chaos took the blood from her mother's remains and flicked it over the world her sisters had created. The five Sisters looked on in amazement even as the blood landed all about, and where it touched the surface it life sprang up, vital and thrumming with possibility. Carried away by her own brilliance, Chaos spilled her own blood and cast it onto the surface, even as her sisters shouted their outrage. Where Chaos' own blood mixed with Mother's blood, the life that spawned grew yet more complex and intelligent, and so all the Quick peoples of the world were born.

The first four Sisters were so outraged by the presumption of Chaos that they turned on her, and cast her out. She fled under their terrible anger, and was seen no more in the void. The four Sisters gorged themselves for many ages on the remains of the First Mother, and themselves grew large and idle from their plenty.

But eventually, hunger once again began to gnaw at their bodies and spirits, and they waxed combative, even as their own bodies waned. One by one they shrank, their youth preserving their vitality through their hunger though it consumed their very bodies. In time, the four Sisters grew small enough that they might visit the world which they had created in search of sustenance, though to the Quick they would be as giants.

But when the Sisters arrived they found that Chaos had been long amongst the Quick of Imaval, spreading discontent and conflict. Immediately they turned their wills to truly casting out Chaos as they had intended. The battles which followed were long and evil. Fire raised up terrible burning mountains which spewed forth molten rock, Earth sent quakes through the very firmament of the land , Water brought monstrous waves crashing onto the shores, and Air sent storms howling through every corner of the world. But Chaos was equal to them, and turned her sisters' weapons of war back upon themselves, and before long all alliances were broken and trust was lost, and each of the five made war against the other four.

For an age the world was wracked with violence and combat, but none of the sisters foresaw that the Quick would rebel against them all. All of the peoples of the world came together and their most powerful sorcerers were able to banish the corporeal forms of the five Sisters. Their fighting did not cease however, and they still make war on each other in the ethereal world, where their efforts are occasionally powerful enough to wrack even the physical world with disasters once again.

Thus the world of Imaval and the great domain of Emkuthav, and all living things, Quick or dull were created by the offspring of the First Mother, kept safe under her watchful eyes.
