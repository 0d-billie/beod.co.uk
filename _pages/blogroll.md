I recently read about [blogrolls](https://www.usebox.net/jjm/blog/have-a-blogroll/), the idea being that if you write on the Internet you should link to the other things that you read to spread the love. So here's what I read on the regular:

[**The Alexandrian**](https://thealexandrian.net/)  
A great resource for TTRPG players, full of advice that I have implemented in many of my own games and game design.

[**Asahi Linux**](https://asahilinux.org/blog/)  
I don't currently use Asahi, but I was for a good year. It's a great project and their writeups of reverse engineering Apple's hardware are really interesting (if completely over my head much of the time).

[**Cassidy James Blaede**](https://cassidyjames.com/blog/)  
I like keeping up with the world of desktop Linux, and Cassidy typically comes at it from a design perspective, which is always interesting.

[**The Chatner**](https://www.thechatner.com/)  
I came for the advice on coming out, and I stayed for the fun literary commentary.

[**Elementary Blog**](https://blog.elementary.io/)  
Another Linux project that I no longer use but I like to stay up to date with. I was a paid up user of elementary for a long time, and I find their team's perspective on design to be really interesting.

[**Exile Lifestyle**](https://exilelifestyle.com/)  
I like Colin's musings on life and his general philosophy. As a bad minimalist myself, it's nice to follow the work of someone doing it much better than me.

[**Family of Me**](https://familyofme.com/)  
This is a fictionalised account of a trans woman healing parts of her identity, and doing a lot of work to soothe her inner children. Lots of tears.

[**Grammarianism**](https://grammarianism.wordpress.com/)  
A bit of linguistics never goes amiss, and this is a look at teaching English grammar in English schools, which is a curious topic.

[**Kagi**](https://blog.kagi.com/blog)  
Yes, I pay for a search engine. But it's a really good one, and it's another step towards de-googling my life.

[**Nebula**](https://blog.nebula.tv/)  
I originally signed up to Nebula for to watch [The Prince](https://blog.nebula.tv/the-prince-special-edition/), but there is a lot of really great content over there, and their model for paying creators is really good.

[**OMG! Ubuntu!**](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/)  
When I first came to Linux this site was my bible. I don't use Ubuntu any more, but I like keeping up with the developments over there.

[**Own Your Web**](https://buttondown.email/ownyourweb)  
In the days of enshittification, owning a corner of the Internet feels ever more necessary (hence the existence of this here site). This is a good resource for maintaining a web presence.

[**Query Shark**](https://queryshark.blogspot.com/)
I'm an aspiring author, and it's good to see what a good cover letter for getting a publisher to notice you should look like.  

[**Signal**](https://signal.org/blog/)  
My messaging app of choice, I like to keep up with the development.

[**Stained Glass Woman**](https://stainedglasswoman.substack.com/)  
A fantastic blog about trans topics, written in great, nigh-academic detail. Instrumental in helping me figure some things out.

[**XKCD**](https://xkcd.com)  
Need I say more? Probably the Internet creator I've been following the longest.

[**You Probably Don't Need**](https://ypdn.substack.com/)  
Another Colin Wright project, this one arguing against the necessity of a lot of objects and attitudes. Good minimalist work.
