excerpt: "CHANGE ME BEFORE PUBLISHING"

Spend time really thinking about your goals, objectives, dreams, values
List them, tag them, categorise them, sort them

Define the first, second, third most important tags and categories

Write these down somewhere you can see them regularly
Work towards them for a year
Revisit them
Repeat

For me:

Legacy <- Health <- Support
