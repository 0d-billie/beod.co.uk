## Things I would do differently

I left a very long time between coming out to myself and coming out to (in particular) my family, and that proved to be an incredibly challenging experience the further down the road I travelled. Deadnames and old pronouns were obviously my constant companions, and it became increasingly hard to spend time among people who did not know I was trans. Given how accepting my family proved to be, I needn't have waited as long as I did, and I may have saved myself a lot of distress and dysphoria had I taken the plunge sooner.


- Be bolder about my name
  - In part 2 I spoke about choosing a name, and I have been going by Billie for over 3 years at this point
    - Part of me regrets not being bolder about my choice of name, or having to re-update everyone in my life about another name change
      - I was loathe to make a fuss, but perhaps I should have made _slightly_ more of a fuss than I did

- Starting the medical side of things sooner
